PenniesForGood is a google chrome extension that asks you to round up 
your online Amazon purchases and donate the difference to a 
choice of 3 charities relating to the product you buy. We believe that micro-donations can make a macro difference.

This project was built during HackDuke 2019 and won the Best 
Non-Profit Hack Award. I worked on the charity selection page 
of the extension (html, css, js) which included tasks such as 
generating the charities based on the item purchased as well as
 providing information on the charity when hovered over. I also
  worked on retrieving/storing information using the Chrome 
  Storage API.

I also designed the logo using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.

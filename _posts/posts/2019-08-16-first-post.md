Hey, I’m Raymond, an incoming freshman at Duke University from Toronto, Canada.

As I begin this new stage of my life, I thought it would be a good idea to document some of my thoughts and experiences throughout this process. I figured a blog would be the best way to do so. 

Although this is probably going to become a portfolio website of some sort that supposed to be selling myself to potential employers, I want to keep this blog pure. This blog will contain my honest opinions only. No sugar coating allowed.

All over the internet these days we see college application reaction videos and documentation of people’s first days of college making college seem like such an amazing experience. I don’t want to say this won’t be the case, but it definitely doesn’t seem too genuine to me. 

I’m still incredibly excited to start college in a few days and I hope you all stick around for my journey at Duke over the next four years.

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I'm Raymond, a Chinese-Canadian first-year student at Duke University (&#x1F535;&#x1F608;) from Toronto intending
        on double majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science (ECE/CS).
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy messing around in my spare time building websites, learning about machine learning, and making all sorts of programs. Outside
        of coding, I love playing and watching basketball (huge Raptors fan <img class = "emoji" src="/assets/rap.png">)
        cooking and playing strategy games like Dominion, (auto) chess, and Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
        I figured that having a blog of sorts would be a great way for me to record my thoughts about
        college, tech, food, gaming or whatever is on my mind at the time.
